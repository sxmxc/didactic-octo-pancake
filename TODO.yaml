      - id: core.menu_bar_unification
        title: Unified menu bar + drawer profiles
        priority: critical
        status: done
        owner: unassigned
        problem: >-
          The shared `MenuBar` + drawer system now drives the world-view HUD, but focus view
          still relies on the legacy `focus_view_menu.tscn`, and documentation hasn't caught up.
          We need to finish migrating focus view to the new profile workflow and capture the
          architecture so future buttons/drawers are easy to add.
        entrypoints:
          - scenes/ui/ui.tscn (SubViewport hierarchy + HUDMenuBar owner)
          - scenes/ui/menu_bar.tscn / scenes/ui/menu_bar.gd
          - scenes/ui/drawers/menu_drawer.gd (animation/input handling)
          - scenes/ui/drawers/*_drawer.tscn|gd (creature, eggs, build, food, details)
          - scenes/ui/focus_view_menu.tscn (legacy to retire after migration)
          - README.md
          - TODO.yaml
        blockers: []
        subtasks:
          - description: ✅ Author `scenes/ui/menu_bar.tscn` with shared button row, ButtonGroup toggles,
              drawer host, and save/zoom signals (world profile live).
          - description: ✅ Create drawer scenes (creature list, egg catalog, build shop, food bag,
              creature details) extending `MenuDrawer`, hooked under the SubViewport.
          - description: ✅ Implement profile data/API so the bar swaps button sets; world profile is
              wired, focus profile still needs migration onto HUDMenuBar.
          - description: ✅ Wire buttons to animated drawers (single-open enforcement, icon tweens,
              build drag auto-close) and remove redundant world menu logic.
          - description: ✅ Document the new HUD architecture + usage in README/TODO once focus migration
              is complete.
          - description: ✅ Migrate focus view to the shared `MenuBar` profile (zoom + creature details
              buttons, drawer content) and delete the old `focus_view_menu` scene/scripts.
        definition_of_done: >-
          A single menu_bar scene drives both world/focus HUDs, buttons toggle drawers cleanly,
          save appears only in world view, zoom only in focus view, documentation covers the flow,
          and the legacy menus are removed.

        problem: >-
          The current creature behavior tree only contains a handful of basic actions (idle,
          sleep, eat, wander), so creatures never perform richer interactions like grooming,
          social play, nest maintenance, or curiosity-driven exploration.

              or blackboard variables so behaviors can branch in more interesting ways.
          - description: Update Creature.gd to register the new actions/conditions and expose any
              tuning constants needed by designers.
          - description: Document action names, triggers, and side effects in README.md and ensure
              TODO.yaml references stay in sync once implemented.
        definition_of_done: >-
          Creatures regularly demonstrate the new actions in sandbox playtests, blackboard data is

              through daily login rewards, achievements, or in-game currency purchases.
          - description: Update spawn logic so creatures only hatch when an egg token is
              consumed, respecting weighted RNG tables per egg tier.
          - description: Surface reward cadence, inventory counts, and hatch odds in the UI
              so players understand acquisition and consumption flows.
          - description: Replace the temporary debug egg catalog in `scenes/ui/world_view_menu.tscn`
              with the authoritative inventory + pack UX once backend rules exist.
        definition_of_done: >-
          Eggs no longer appear for free; players earn/stock egg tokens via login rewards or
          purchases, inventory counts gate spawns, and weighted RNG tables determine hatch
          results with clear documentation.

              purchases, including price tiers for USD (or platform equivalents).
          - description: Select/pay mock gateways (Stripe test mode, Steam wallet, platform IAP) and
              describe how Talo will verify receipts before granting items.
          - description: Document refund/chargeback handling plus how real-money purchases convert into
              in-game egg inventory or currency balances.
        definition_of_done: >-
          Pricing tables, gateway integration plans, and entitlement validation steps are documented,
          Talo exposes placeholders/hooks for real-currency receipts, and the storefront can surface
          both soft- and hard-currency options even if final payment SDKs are stubbed.
